Engineered loss functions, computed gradients, and implemented gradient descent algorithms. Evaluated the performance of linear perceptrons and logistic regression models.

### Neural Networks
Constructed a three-layer multi-class neural network, including a bespoke implementation using `NumPy` for both forward pass and backpropagation.

### CNN for Classification and Localization
Developed convolutional neural networks for image classification and localization tasks.

### RNN and Image Captioning
Implemented Recurrent Neural Networks (`RNNs`) utilizing `NumPy` and integrated `ResNet152` for feature extraction to generate descriptive image captions.

## Data Streaming Algorithms and Online Learning <a name="data-streaming-algorithms-and-online-learning"></a>

### Flajolet-Martin and Count-min-sketch Analysis
- **Flajolet-Martin Algorithm:** Implemented and analyzed the Flajolet-Martin algorithm for estimating the number of distinct elements in a data stream via a single pass.
- **Count-min Sketch:** Developed and evaluated the Count-min sketch probabilistic data structure, serving as a frequency table of events in a stream of data.

### Comparative Analysis of Dimension Reduction Algorithms (Work in Progress)
Conducted a comprehensive comparison of dimensionality reduction algorithms on the `CIFAR-10` dataset, focusing on enhancing accuracy and execution efficiency. The algorithms include PCA, Johnson-Lindenstrauss, and Autoencoders.
