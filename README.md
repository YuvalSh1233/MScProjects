## Master's Degree Projects Repository

In the following repository, MScProjects, I present my academic endeavors from my master's studies.

### Projects Overview:
1. **Introduction to Deep Learning:**
   - **Linear Image Classifier:** Developed loss functions, computed gradients, and implemented gradient descent. Trained and assessed linear perceptrons and logistic regression models.
   - **Neural Networks:** Engineered a three-layer multi-class neural network, including a self-implementation using NumPy for forward pass and backpropagation.
   - **CNN for Classification and Localization:** (Work in Progress)
   - **RNN and Image Captioning:** Implemented Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using NumPy, followed by leveraging ResNet152 for feature extraction. These features were employed to feed the RNN model for generating image captions.

This repository underscores my commitment and proficiency in deep learning concepts and their practical applications during my academic journey.
