## Master's Degree Project Repository

The following repository showcasing the culmination of my academic journey during my master's studies.

### Project Overview:
1. **Introduction to Deep Learning:**
   - Linear Image Classifier: Engineered loss functions, computed gradients, and implemented gradient descent algorithms. Evaluated the performance of linear perceptrons and logistic regression models.
   - Neural Networks: Constructed a three-layer multi-class neural network, including a bespoke implementation using NumPy for both forward pass and backpropagation.
   - CNN for Classification and Localization: 
   - RNN and Image Captioning: Implemented Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) utilizing NumPy and integrated ResNet152 for feature extraction. These features were then utilized to enrich the RNN model for generating descriptive image captions.
   
2. **Data Streaming Algorithms and Online Learning**:
	Exploring real-time data processing techniques for continual learning.
	- Flajolet-Martin and Count-min-sketch Analysis:
	   - *Flajolet-Martin Algorithm:* Implemented and analyzed the Flajolet-Martin algorithm for estimating the number of distinct elements in a data stream via a single pass.
	   - *Count-min Sketch:* Developed and evaluated the Count-min sketch probabilistic data structure, serving as a frequency table of events in a stream of data.
	   
	- Comparative Analysis of Dimension Reduction Algorithms: (Work in Progress)
	   - *PCA, Johnson-Lindenstrauss, and Autoencoders:* Conducted a comprehensive comparison of dimensionality reduction algorithms on the CIFAR-10 dataset, focusing on enhancing accuracy and execution efficiency.
	   
3. Signal Processing for Artificial Intelligence in Audio Applications:
	Exploration of speaker-noise separation through transfer learning with pre-trained Wav U-Net models tailored for musical instrument separation.
