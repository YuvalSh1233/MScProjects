## Introduction to Deep Learning <a name="introduction-to-deep-learning"></a>

### Linear Image Classifier
Loss functions and gradient descent implemented from scratch with `NumPy`. Evaluated the performance of linear perceptrons and logistic regression models.

### Neural Networks
Constructed a three-layer multi-class neural network using `NumPy` for both forward pass and backpropagation.

### CNN for Classification and Localization
Created convolutional neural networks for image classification and localization tasks.

### RNN and Image Captioning
Implemented Recurrent Neural Networks (`RNNs`) utilizing `NumPy` and integrated `ResNet152` for feature extraction to generate descriptive image captions.

## Data Streaming Algorithms and Online Learning <a name="data-streaming-algorithms-and-online-learning"></a>

### Flajolet-Martin and Count-min-sketch Analysis
- **Flajolet-Martin Algorithm:** Implemented and analyzed the Flajolet-Martin algorithm for estimating the number of distinct elements in a data stream via a single pass.
- **Count-min Sketch:** Developed and evaluated the Count-min sketch probabilistic data structure, serving as a frequency table of events in a stream of data.

### Comparative Analysis of Dimension Reduction Algorithms (Work in Progress)
Employed the CIFAR-10 dataset and utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Johnson-Lindenstrauss methods, and Autoencoder techniques to reduce dimensionality. Our aim was to classify data within the latent space and subsequently compare the achieved results in terms of accuracy and execution time against the conventional ResNet18 pipeline.

### Speaker-Noise Separation with Wav U-Net
Performed transfer learning techniques using pre-trained `Wav U-Net` models for separating speakers from noise in audio recordings, with a specific focus on musical instrument separation.
