## Master's Degree Projects Repository

In the following repository, I present my academic endeavors from my master's studies.

### Projects Overview:
1. **Introduction to Deep Learning:**
   - **Linear Image Classifier:** Developed loss functions, computed gradients, and implemented gradient descent. Trained and assessed linear perceptrons and logistic regression models.
   - **Neural Networks:** Engineered a three-layer multi-class neural network, including a self-implementation using NumPy for forward pass and backpropagation.
   - **CNN for Classification and Localization:** (Work in Progress)
   - **RNN and Image Captioning:** Implemented Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using NumPy, followed by leveraging ResNet152 for feature extraction. These features were employed to feed the RNN model for generating image captions.
   
2. Data Streaming Algorithms and Online Learning:
	holding a sketch of memory in real time flow of data for making estimation about the entire data.
	a. Flajolet-Martin and Count-min-sketch analysis:
	   a1. Implememnting and analysis Flajolet-Martin algorithm for estimating number of distinct elements in a stream using a single pass
	   a2. Implememnting and analysis of count min sketch for probablistic data structure serves as a frequency table of events in a stream of data.
